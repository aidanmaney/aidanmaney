Hello, My name is **Aidan Maney**. I'm a Computer Science student at University of California, Santa Cruz. I spend most of my free time fighting whichever Linux installation I've just spun up, working on designs for mobile apps, or reading. If you need to contact me send me an email at **aidanmaney@duck.com**. Thanks for stopping by.
